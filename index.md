		... what someone is, is more than words. It's more than what we have done. It's more than what we have achieved. It's more than what others think we have achieved. It's how Christ describes us. His eternal plan for our lives that we seek to fullfill.<br>
		I'm a Jesus freak in the mildest of terms! I love people. I love what I do.<br>

She got hooked up on God for the last few months of her life and that got us connected.<br>She was an amaizing person. A cool and calm personality.😍😍😍😍<br>I fail to articulate the feeling inside of me. Though I miss her. I know she is better off. You will be missed great person.<br>😘Love😍😍😍😍you😘.
