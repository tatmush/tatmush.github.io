<h1>Hackerthon culture in Zimbabwe</h1>

<h3>How it all began?</h3>
<p>
	<b>tl;dr</b> Read these posts to get an idea. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> and somebody on <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-origins-of-hackathons" target="_blank">quora</a>. I don't really care about how it all began, its a good concept either way or at least outside Zim.<br>
	Before we get into the gist of the blog let me settle something I just noted...
</p>
<h3>hackerthon vs hackathon</h3>
<p>I don't care too, either works for me, so I'll use both interchangeably<br></p><br>

<h3>My hackathon idea</h3>
<img src="/assets/img/Saturday-THORNS/techCrunch.jpeg">
<p>
	My hackerthon mentality comes from watching events like Tech Crunch disrupt. I think a hackathon is a developer meet up where we gather to build <u>anything</u> <del>noteworthy</del> functional. No matter how stupid it might be, it must be something at least. By something I certainly don't mean an idea or fantasy or something you want to try out in the future.<br>
</p>
<p>
	There are many types of hackathons if you read through the wikipedia document but I'll define fundamental principles for hackerthons that I regard to be pivotal, both for organizers and participants.<hr>
</p>

<ul><h3>Checklist</h3></ul>

<li><h5>Food</h5></li>
<p>If you are going to host a hackerthon make sure you have food, please!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠ I've gone to hackathons hosted by organizations I highly rank and found them to be lumoless(foodless). I wont mention names here but organizers come on!ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. <br>
We've had one hackerthon as Saturday THORNS so far and we didn't have food. Its okay not to have food because of budget reasons so give developers a heads up on that because when we come, we want that food.</p>
<li><h5>T-Shirts and swag</h5></li>
<p>I don't really mind about the T-shirts. Swag stuff is nice too but i usually give away most of my swag stuff unless you give me a gadget or something really cool or unique.<br><br></p>
<p>
	I have a seperate gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/tatmush/5dec6b92010fc9391cd87572c2549338" target="_blank">here</a> for a developers checklist to attend a hackathon if you really want to participate. Please add your thoughts too.

	Now to the GIST of the matter(pun intended). I don't think its the organizers fault that things have turned out the way they are. Zimbabwean devs are $%#^#^. You host a hackathon intending to get a product out of it and all you get is a powerpoint presentation from good english speaking guys lying to you about AI. Half of them have never done anything on AI, not even that simple digit recognition thingy.<br>
	Whats more crazy is that these $^#$&* <del>developers</del> talkers go on to win the prize. Fake it till you make it huh? But as Linus shot it straight, talk is cheap, show me the code.<br>
</p>
<p>
	Well, it is what it is. I've have been watching stuff about Theranos. If you haven't heard of it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CccfnRpPtM">Youtube</a> it. You may fake it till you make it but truth is you are empty inside.<br></p>
<p>
	I'll slip out of this outrage lol. I've been to hackathons were dzungu and good english turn out to be the most important aspects of a hackerthon. Maybe the outrage is of the fact that i never won any hackathon, but i never really desired to win any because i knew that the apps i had made were not working.<br>
</p>
<p>
	So in the end, the organizers are tired too. They host expensive events for people who end up giving speeches of the trending topics we all can read on.<br><br>
	Of course there are reasons why developers fail to produce anything worth a mention. We'll deal with that on twitter.<br><br>
</p>

<h2>How we are changing things?</h2>

<p>
	Thats when Saturday THORNS was born. We want developers who really have something to show for it. We want to host hackerthons were developers come up with something like the bro app on silicon valley (no homo), its stupid but it works and is really there.<br>
	Read our documents <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SO87iL2HF33L7WO-SppeLsUBefOh6rPj">here</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=181MsU82fhNyg8iZPqYZ_ZGQjd1SArU7v">here</a>
</p>
<p>
	So on the 9th of March we had our first Saturday THORN without food unfortunately. I was dead broke I couldn't buy myself lunch but we'll have sponsors soon. I invited my friends over for the hackerthon during the week and gave them a brief heads up on what we were going to build. <br>
	Only one friend did turn up after inviting 3 of them. A faithful companion whom I have been attending hackerthons with since we knew about them. We hacked up something <a href="http://devsrank.herokuapp.com/">here</a> and I'm proud of what we did. Its extremely buggy i would say, but hey its something we made and could demo up. Visit our github repo to contribute <a href="https://github.com/tatmush/Saturday-THORN-Dev-Rank">here</a>. The primary idea is to rank developers based on their performance and award points to them based on that.<br>
</p>

<p>
	But it dawned on me that I was once a newbie or still am and was allowed to partake in these hackathons albeit disappointing the organizers. I appreciate every single thing I've learnt in those hackathons because they have immensely contributed to this blog post and my thoughts on Saturday THORNS. And if you one developer who hasn't won a hackathon, continue attending, don't worry about that other stuff it doesn't matter. You get to network and learn cool new stuff. Our goal is to improve the developer culture but at the same time we don't want to create a barrier for the new guys that are coming in. So at times we have felt to discontinue making the app but you know, once we start we gotta finish.
</p>
<br>
<p>
	Our desire is bring something like Tech Crunch Disrupt to our country, but events like that, money like that, prizes like that wont come if developers don't improve on their skills. Thats why I have a gist <a href="https://gist.github.com/tatmush/5dec6b92010fc9391cd87572c2549338" target="_blank">here</a> for a person who wants to attend a hackerthon.
