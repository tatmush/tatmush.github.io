	<h1>Why do we to go to college or university?</h1>
	<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">tl;dr</span> Know what you want. Do what you want.<br>
		Allow me to use college and university interchangeably in this blog.<hr></p>
	<p>
		People go to university for different reasons, many people go to university for no reason. So I will gladly take this opportunity to bore you about my reasons for going and why I don't want to graduate.
	</p>
	<p>
		I chose to go to university because it is/was the status quo. Thats it!<br>
		It was expected of me so I just applied and went. Of cause there is an interesting story behind my application choices and procedures but thats meant for another blog.
	</p> 
	<p>
		Being a loud mouth, let me just mention signs of going to college for no reason (by no reason I mean money, friends, family pressure, ego):
		<ul>
			<li>Bunking</li>
			<li>Hating most of the courses (obviously you can't love all the courses)</li>
			<li>Hate to study</li>
			<li>Hate research</li>
			<li>Failing to keep up with the trends.</li>
			<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Bad grades</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h1>The awakening</h1>
	<p>
		Soon after enrolling I realized that I was at college for education or rather seeking knowledge. Knowledge, I did get but the more I knew, the more I did not know. I realized the size of the body of knowledge I was trying to acquire and master. In humble terms, it was a futile attempt to master all of that.<br>
		I will highlight organs of the body of knowledge that I "amassed" over the 2 years spent in lectures.
		<ul>
			<li>Fundamentals of Computer Systems</li>
			<li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
			<li>Introduction to Information Security</li>
			<li>Operating Systems</li>
			<li>Computer Programming</li>
			<li>Number Theory</li>
			<li>Database Design Concepts</li>
			<li>Visual Programming Concepts</li>
			<li>Programming Techniques</li>
			<li>Software Engineering</li>
			<li>Coding Theory</li>
			<li>Secure Programming</li>
			<li>Cryptography and Security</li>
			<li>Case Studies in Information Security</li>
			<li>Cyberspace Ethics and Laws</li>
			<li>Microcomputer Systems Hardware</li>
		</ul>
		This is not all the courses, I was lazy to add the other courses. The point I am trying to make is that each of these courses is a vast field of study on its own such that if one decides to pursue it, they can spend an entire lifetime and get a PhD in such fields. But being a student you only study  the field for about 12 weeks for exposure and appreciation of the concepts.
	</p>
	<h1>Why I don't want to graduate?</h1>
	<p>
		 My concern is that many people don't understand why this is done. I believe the reason for that 12 week bootcamp in those courses is to bring us to the point of inspiration or revelation (because I am a spiritual person). The awakening inside us that gets us engaged in that field to pursue it diligently.
	</p>
	<p>
		My whole line of thought is based on how I define "pursue diligently". By that I mean dropping college and starting your own initiatives based on the body of knowledge that excites you. Getting employed in industry that is actively participating in the subject you are interested in.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is very scary and worrying when you find yourself graduating without ever having been excited about any course related to the program you are studying for. You maybe lost and need a compass.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am not lost. My niche is blockchain. And I am determined to leave school before my internship ends to launch my startup. I've told my girlfriend and sister about it, I dare not say a word to my parents until my company is disrupting The Bond and Ecocash.
