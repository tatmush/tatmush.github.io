<h1>My programming journey</h1>

<div>
	<p>
		One day, in the <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">thats when most of my ideas come</span>bathroom</a> I looked back to realize my programming journey and this is a summary of that contemplation.</p><hr>
	<p>
		My first knowledge about the idea of giving instructions to computers to control them came around 2015/16, I don't know how per se but it was a time of many questions for me. I literally googled everything that came to my mind. I  remember googling on my Nokia X2, Samsung galaxy pocket or Nokia e63 or which ever I had in space-time and that's when I discovered what programming is.
	</p>
	<p>
		In fact  my journey in IT was driven by a desire to hack. I googled around and found a book by Al Sweigart about hacking ciphers <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/hacking/">here</a>. It was a gracious break because I didn't even have enough money/data to google much around. I didn't even know that YouTube existed.		
	</p>
	<p>
		Be it as it may, I found the book, and were guidelines in there to download a python interpreter and some other stuff which I did on my phone then load them onto my computer.
	</p>
	This is a picture of my first hello world from the book.<img src="/assets/img/programmersJourney/firstHello.JPG" style="border-radius: 25px;">
	<p>
		I was so so thrilled, learning about {% highlight python %} if, else, elif, def {% endhighlight %} and made a simple "chatbot" full of if and else statements, gave it to my dad to "chat" with. It would ask him questions and he would answer in a yes or no fashion and it would give back a funny and funky responses to make it more interesting before asking another question.
	</p>
	<p>
		Days went by as I learned how to hack  <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">come to think of it, maybe thats why i have a good understanding of cryptography</span>ciphers</a>. Later on I met a relative who was studying Civil Engineering at Stellenbosch and was blown even further. He exposed me to the Java world and gave me a stack of books, tutorials and so forth which I still have today. I remember telling him about my experiences as well and promising him that soon, I would be able to hack the pattern you put on your phone to <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Of cause I was nuts. I have the algorithm though, never had the time to write the code and give the proof of work but i have done the calculations necessary for a brute force</span>unlock it.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		So looked through the books and came across Java, I watched a couple of tutorials and was reading from a book "The Complete Reference, Java 8", if I am not mistaken. My blog actually starts here.
	</p>
	<h3>My 3 stages</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<h6>Cramming and confusion</h6>
				<p>
					I thought reading this book would make me "THE COMPLETE PROGRAMMER", the book is about a 1200 pages, divided into 3 parts. I read and read and read and read and read and finished the first part which is around <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">I'm quite reader</span> 500 pages I think </a>. That got me to understand the dynamics of object oriented programming, encapsulation, inheritance, constructors and methods, overloading them, threads, exception handling, I/O.<br>
					Getting into the second part of the book was quite complicated. I was going through an API reference and documentation trying to grasp everything. My head must have grown big that time. It actually did and never returned to normal. Obviously the outcome was impossible.<br>
					Later on some missionaries from the states came to our church that summer and one of the ladies introduced herself as a programmer. My heart completely lit up, because I could ask all the burning questions I had and get clarification from a real human being and not from a screen on a phone. Sadly,I lost her contact and have forgotten her name but she was from Mississippi, home of the <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">at least thats what she told me</span>blues.</a> I asked if I should and could really know the whole API and she laughed hard and said NO. I was so was glad because deep inside I knew I couldn't do it. This was my first burnout let me say.<br>
					<p class="description">
					This is the stage, where university students finish at. They don't really understand why we need loops, why we need decisions in programming, functions, methods, parameters and arguments. Part of the causality is that the lecturers don't articulate this very well maybe because the concepts are really difficult to explain.<br>
					Its difficult to change someones line of thought. You can only try by leading them on with pieces of information and hope for the process to occur within them.<br>
					I don't really have an answer for escape but I think asking the right questions is a good place to start.

			<h6>Stack overflow and GitHub</h6>

				Fast forward and I'm in college. Its funny after all this I still didn't understand myself enough to know that I love computers and should probably study that in college. I ended up studying another seriously misunderstood but interesting field of polymers. During this time at university, I became acquainted with YouTube and Wikipedia and other knowledge sites where I did a lot of catch-up.<br>
				Please take my catch-up into perspective. Facebook was made in 2003/04. People had already begun innovating on the Internet. New technologies where being made constantly. Bitcoin came in 2009. There was so much to know for me Git, Apache, the Cloud, Linux, IoT, AI; these were terms flying around me and I had no whisker of an idea what that meant. I also didn't have much time and resources to <a href="#" class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">To show you the gravity of my lack  of understanding, I began to know about other operating systems apart from windows. I downloaded ubuntu and double clicked it to run on my windows as if it was a .exe</span> learn.</a><br>
				Back to programming, I began to know other languages like php, c, c++ and so forth. So the race became, know all these languages which was a bigger burden than the API challenge. Come to think of it. The more I know, the more I don't know.<br>
				Programming was now about syntax and knowing many languages whatever that means. Getting the basics of the language, know the syntax and not having to know much about the API. Upon a project, assignment, bug or whatever I would rush to find the code that works without worrying about security, scalability, sustainability or whatever metric there is to use.<br>
				I thought this was the resting place of my programming until that bathroom moment when I graduated from this level.<br>
				<p class="description">
					This stage was filled with impatience and lacked of a mentor. I took pride in knowing a language. Filled with desires to run to the rare languages like Go, Erlang, R because somebody was just talking about it or a hype from a YouTube video. Trying to know so many languages and put that on my resume. I say all this, not in a condescending way. My current resume is like that.<br>
					This mental state would lead me into trying to build an android app with languages like c. Of cause it might be possible and one can do it. Other people do it.

				<h6>Engineering and problem solving.</h6>
				In the bathroom and that moment of reminiscence is when I realized what programming had evolved to for me.I realized programming wasn't about the language or syntax because that results in @#^&(*@) code. I ended up writing what needs to be written but writing it badly.<br>
				Programming became engineering and problem solving. It evolved to solving problems in the most efficient and smartest way than about syntax issues. Speaking of which, I think the question of syntax in an interview is really petty because a good programmer can take a week or two to google and grasp the syntax issues but you wont take as much time to understand the paradigm of the programming language. The essence of the language (panyama or pahasha). Why was the language made and where it fits in on providing a solution to the problem. Concepts like functional programming, prototypal inheritance, object oriented programming are difficult to google and apply. The questions themselves are difficult to formulate before googling them. They are concepts developed by a mentor, expert or by experience in programming.<br>
				The right tool that can fix the problem at hand. Some tools will require making on your own. This is how Graphql started. Its a tool that fixes a problem and now other companies are adopting the tool and using it on their API's as well because it fixes problems.<br>
				My idea of programming can change anytime soon, as long as I continue to bath and have enlightenment moments. So currently I am not aligned to any language. My concern now is about the engineering problem.<br>
				The customer or the business does not care how many languages you know and what technologies you used to build your app. They want a working product that fixes a problem thats all. <br>
				The perspective has shifted for me, the perfect tool for the job.
